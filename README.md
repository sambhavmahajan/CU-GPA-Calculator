## Introduction

The GPA Calculator is a simple command-line Java application designed to help students calculate their GPA quickly and accurately. It takes inputs of grades and corresponding credits for each subject and computes the GPA based on the standard grading system.

## Usage

To use the GPA Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `GpaCalc.java` file using a Java compiler.
3. Run the compiled program using `java GpaCalc`.
4. Follow the prompts to input the grades and credits for each subject.
5. The program will output the calculated GPA.

## How it Works

The GPA Calculator utilizes a HashMap to map grades to their respective grade points. It then prompts the user to input the grades and credits for each subject. After gathering all the necessary information, it calculates the GPA by multiplying each grade's grade point by the corresponding credit, summing these products, and dividing by the total possible grade points.
